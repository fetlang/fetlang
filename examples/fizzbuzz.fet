(
Classic FizzBuzz program in Fetlang with characters from Buffy the Vampire
Slayer

Rules:
	For numbers 1 to 100:
		print "Fizz Buzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and 5
		print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3 but not 5
		print "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5 but not 3
		Otherwise, just print the number
)

(Our limit)
Lick Spike's belly button one hundred times

(This is our counter var...setting to one)
lick Buffy's ears

(We need to have a zero (and since Xander's kind of a loser...))
Flog Xander

Lick Giles five times
Lick Angel three times

(main loop)
until Spike is submissive to Buffy
	(Set willow to Buffy%5)
	Have Xander worship Willow
	Have Buffy lick Willow's nose
	Have Giles tickle Willow (This seems a bit out of character...We might need to refactor)

	if Willow is Xander's submissive
		(Set willow to Buffy%3)
		Have Xander worship Willow
		Have Buffy lick Willow's nose
		Have Angel tickle Willow

		if Willow is Xander's submissive, still
			make slave scream "Fizz Buzz"
		otherwise
			make slave scream "Buzz"
	otherwise
		(Set willow to Buffy%3)
		Have Xander worship Willow
		Have Buffy lick Willow's nose
