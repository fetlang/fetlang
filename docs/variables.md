# Variables

## Tokenizing/Identifiers

Variable names are case-insensitive. Characters that can be used in an
identifier can be, but are not limited to: alphanumeric ASCII, underscores,
hyphens, or spaces. Tokenization ends at a newline, a keyphrase, or at the
start of a literal.

Identifiers expressing possession are the same as their possessor. For
example:

`Richard Stallman's sexy feet` is the same as `riCHard StallMAN`

## Types

The [type](types.md) of a variable is implied by the first operation it is in.
If it is in a situation in which it could either be a fraction or chain, it
will default to fraction.

Chain type variables are initiated to `""`, while fraction type variables are
initiated to `zero`

## Gender

Variables can be assigned one of four genders: male, female, neutral, and
nonperson. Additionally, an N/A (not applicable) gender exists, but cannot be
assigned to a variable by the programmer. No variable starts with a gender
(that is, they start with `UNASSIGNED_GENDER`), but is assigned one by an
initial use of a pronoun.

Each gender is associated with a group of pronouns:  
Male - `HIM`/`HIMSELF`/`HIS`/`HIS OWN`  
Female - `HER`/`HERSELF`/`HER`/`HER OWN`  
Neutral - `THEY`/`THEMSELF`/`THEIR`/`THEIR OWN`  
Nonperson - `IT`/`ITSELF`/`ITS`/`ITS OWN`  

`HIS` and `HIS OWN` are the possessive versions of `HIM` and `HIMSELF`,
respectively. `HIMSELF` is reflexive. `HIM` is objective.

Male, female, and neutral are used for humanly named variables, like `Harry
Potter`. Nonperson is used for object-ly named variables, like `violet wand`.
N/A is used for non-nouns

## Pronouns

Using a pronoun to describe a variable will imply its gender if it does
not have one yet. Use of an objective pronoun will use the last variable
mentioned that is not in the left-sided operand (not LHO). Use of a
reflexive pronoun will use the variable used in the left-sided operand
(if it cannot, compilation will fail). Use of possessive pronouns act the
same way as possessive identifiers.

Examples:

Subtract `Albert Einstein`(male) from `Albert Einstein`:

    Have Albert Einstein spank himself

Subtract `Leonhard Euler` from `Ada Lovelace`
Multiply `Ada Lovelace`(female) by `Aristotle`(unassigned gender):

    Have Leonhard Euler spank Ada Lovelace
    Have Aristotle worship her feet

Add `Isaac Newton`(male) to `Isaac Newton`

    Have Isaac Newton lick his own paw

You see, a pronoun was made to take the place of a noun, 'cause saying
all those nouns over and over can really wear you down!
